# Canvas
Simple canvas projects, made in order to waste a lot of usefull time, but it comes out with some ''interesting'' animation, taking inspiration from ''the coding train'', but unfortunately
without P5.js, becouse i'm too lazy to include the script each time, so i decided to create them with basic Canvas, Js and lovely Maths.

All in all, it's fun, and that's enough for me

If you want to use, feel free to download, use, sell, destroy, improve, fall in love, sleep with it, or whatever you want, 
i don't know how licence works, so you can also abuse of it, i'll don't know what to do


PS: the code is not optimized in any way, at the same moment that it start working, i haven't worked on it anymore, sorry <3
